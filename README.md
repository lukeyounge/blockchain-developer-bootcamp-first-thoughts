## Intro
Businesses want to acknowledge staff and other stakeholders, and often use corporate gifts to achieve this. Staff members may recieve ornaments, pens, caps, tee-shirts, etc. Sometimes these products are useful, often they gather dust and are a waste of resources.

I'd like to create a simple DIY app for an organisation to mint their own NFTs, then batch deliver those via a redeem link. 

## Basic Use Flow
- Web front end that allows someone to upload image and basic metadata, plus number of NFTs required. 
  -- bonus points if I can provide some randomisation of the artwork, like different colour backgrounds for a PNG with alpha, or randomisation of a collection of files uploaded)
- Mint NFTs gaslessly (on a PoS chain like xDAI, maybe Matic)
- Distribute to their user's wallets (via a link or QR)
  -- bonus points if I can retain a fee for the mint to protocol 
- Ideally a very basic but good looking simple wallet for the user to claim via and see their NFTs

Proof of Attendance Protocol. In many ways my project will share features with POAP, differing mainly in the intent (acknowledgment, recognition for achievemnets, contributions rather than proving attendance)

Rainbow. Rainbow wallet has a sleek and simple interface for NFTs which is also an inspiration.

Scaffold-Eth. Scaffold eth is a really useful framework that I may lean on to get something working.
