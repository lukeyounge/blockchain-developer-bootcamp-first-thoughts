Businesses want to acknowledge staff and other stakeholders, and often use corporate gifts to achieve this. Staff members may recieve ornaments, pens, caps, tee-shirts. Sometimes these products are useful, often they gather dust and are a waste of resources.

I'd like to create a simple DIY app for an organisation to mint their own NFTs, then batch deliver those via a redeem link.

Proof of Attendance Protocol. In many ways my project will share features with POAP, differing mainly in the intent (acknowledgment, recognition for achievemnets, contributions rather than proving attendance)

Rainbow. Rainbow wallet has a sleek and simple interface for NFTs which is also an inspiration.

Needs

- Web front end (react) that allows someone to upload image and basic metadata.
- Mint NFTs gaslessly (on a PoS chain like xDAI)
- Distribute to their user's wallets (via a link or QR)
- Retain a fee for the mint to protocol (this might be complicated)
- Ideally a very basic but good looking simple wallet
